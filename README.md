# Faraday
Citizen Science for a better future

## About Us

From medicine to social media, the world is powered data; we believe science is essential to our future and the first step is breaking down these barriers to entry for the whole world to access. Join us on the first and only DataHub sharing program of the world, the first glimpse into a connected future. 

## Why Faraday?

Michael Faraday was born in 1791 to a poor family in the south of London. He received basic education, however, at the age of 13 he left schooling to help his family's economic struggles. Faraday started his career through book binding, but his love for science helped him climb to important scientific positions. However, his climb to success was not appreaciated by all. Nonetheless, his ability to raise above all bariers and enter the world of science is testament to the power of determination, and his contributions speak to the value of an open community. In history, Faraday is viewed as an exception; it is time to make his story one which all young scientists of  the world can asprire to be. In his honor, this website invites everyone regardless of their background to be the Faraday of tomorrow.

## Setup

* Download the project either as a zip or through GitHub Desktop.
* In your terminal, "cd" into the root directory.
* Now, download the dependencies with:
```

```
* Now, "cd" into the Faraday folder and run the django server through:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Note: If you get windows socket errors, run 'python manage.py runserver 8080' instead to run it on a different port.
* It should be all ready, now just open your favourite browser (it better not be IE) and open: "localhost:8000" or "127.0.0.1:8000".

## Future Aspirations

* Adding open source datapools
* Research integration
* API's
* Merge, pull, and fork requests
* Data adminstrators
* Real money integration w/ PayPal
